Career Guidance Platform for College Students
Project Overview:
The Career Guidance Platform for College Students is a web-based application designed to assist students in making informed decisions about their career paths. The platform allows students to select their academic branch (e.g., CSE, ISE, ECE) and discover various subjects of interest, such as Python Programming, Web Development, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML), and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA with Java). Each interest is linked to a dedicated resources page providing relevant educational materials such as YouTube tutorials, PDF guides, and other useful learning resources.

Features:
Branch Selection: Students can choose their branch of study (e.g., CSE, ISE, ECE).

Interest Selection: Based on the branch selected, students can choose from various career interests related to that branch, such as Python Programming, Web Development, AIML, and DSA with Java.

Resource Links: Each interest contains a set of resources, including YouTube videos, PDF documents, and other learning materials.

Responsive Design: The platform is designed to be responsive, ensuring it works well on both mobile and desktop devices.

Easy Navigation: The platform offers a simple interface that allows students to easily navigate through the selection of branches, interests, and resources.
